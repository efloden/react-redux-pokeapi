# Step 5

Now we have a basic page where we can select one of three starter pokemon.

Lets make a new page where we can view all pokemon, we can handle the routing for this with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/).

In this step we will create a file structure based on [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) to manage our new React components and their CSS.

1. Create a new component folder and files for a `WhoIsIt` component.

```
src
│   README.md
│   app.js
|   app.css
│   ...
└───components
    └───who-is-it
            who-is-it.js
            who-is-it.css
```
